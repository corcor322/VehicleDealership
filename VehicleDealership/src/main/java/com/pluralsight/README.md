# Vehicle Dealership

## Description of the Project

This java application tracks the inventory of vehicles across different dealerships. It allows the user to add and remove cars
 to reflect purchases and changing inventory. It also allows the user to filter the current inventory by things like make and model,
 mileage, and color. This app would be useful for an employee at a car dealership.

## User Stories

These are the user stories that guided my development process:

- As a salesperson, I want a clean and easily navigable interface to save me time.
- As a salesperson, I want the ability to list my current inventory to know what in stock will appeal to my customer.
- As a salesperson, I want the ability to add and remove vehicles to reflect our inventory as it changes.
- As a salesperson, I want the ability to filter cars to narrow down options based on my customer's desires.

## Setup

Instructions on how to set up and run the project using IntelliJ IDEA.

### Prerequisites

- IntelliJ IDEA: Ensure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, which you can download from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
- Java SDK: Make sure Java SDK is installed and configured in IntelliJ.

### Running the Application in IntelliJ

Follow these steps to get your application running within IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Select "Open" and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the project.
3. After the project opens, wait for IntelliJ to index the files and set up the project.
4. Find the main class with the `public static void main(String[] args)` method. This is in the class titled "Main".
5. Right-click on the file and select 'Run 'Main.main()'' to start the application.

## Technologies Used

- Java: Java 17


## Future Work

Additional work that could be done with this project:

- Correctly completing the addVehicle and removeVehicle methods
- filtering multiple fields at the same time
- Adding a customer base to assign purchased vehicles for salespeople to keep track of their clients
- implementing partial matches for the vehicle make and model
